## Introduction :-
The objective of this project is to identify melanoma in images of skin lesions. In particular, we need to use images 
within the same patient and determine which are likely to represent a melanoma. In other words, 
we need to create a model which should predict the probability whether the lesion in the image 
is malignant or benign.Value 0 denotes benign, and 1 indicates malignant

## Implemenetation_details
* Making a custom class to integrate training of meta data and Images together
* Used transfer learning on Image Net . 

## Training Process
* Used EfficientNet B0-B3 and ResNeXt 
* Loss Function : BCE with logit Loss
* Validation Metric : ROC-AUC Score
* Best Score on validation data : 0.9671
* Best Score on test data : 0.9620
* Epochs Trained : 20* 5Folds with Early Stopping if score doesn't improve
* Optimizer : Adam
